# Marvel Comic App for Mutinex

Task: Create a Marvel comic app using the Marvel API (https://developer.marvel.com/docs).


I really appreciate the opportunity to complete this test task for you. Any feedback you have would be greatly appreciated. I spent approximately 8 hours on this task. I experimented with new libraries (shadcn) and learned about modal rendering, as well as furthering my knowledge.

Clone the repo and run:
```pnpm install```
```pnpm dev```
